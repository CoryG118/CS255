# CS255
For this project I designed a system that would identify a user either admin or student. The client DriverPass wanted as system that would allow for students to learn about driving and be able to schedule 
driving lessons. The admin would assist in creating the account for the studne as well as scheduling driving lessons. One strength I believe I had during this project was the level of detail my UMLs have.
The only revision I would make is in the Class UML, the user classes didnt need to be two completely different classes. Instead a user class could be used in inherit from for admin and student. The users 
needs were noted down and address first. Its not my responsiblity to dictate what the customer wants.
